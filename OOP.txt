OOP Defication: OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is about writing procedures
 or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that 
contain both data and functions. ... OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.

Abstruction: Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background 
details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation means information hiding. It's about hiding as much as possible of the object's internal parts 
and exposing a minimal public interface. The simplest and most elegant way to create encapsulation in JavaScript is using closures. 
A closure can be created as a function with private state

Inheritance: Inheritance is an important concept in object oriented programming. In the classical inheritance, 
methods from base class get copied into derived class.

Polymorphism: The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.
 It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language,
 we can pass any type of data members with the methods.
